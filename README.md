# Power User Linux Setup (PULSe)

An opinionated, productivity-and-convenience-oriented one-time run script collection.

The purpose is to set up (almost) everything you need for productive coding in one go.
This, along with source control, is essential to minimize the impact of hardware defects.

An added benefit is the ability to easily replicate your work environment
with the least amount of configuration (there is still some fiddling to be done
with extension configuration which isn't scripted yet).

Hardware specs:
- minimum: 8GB RAM, 1x 27" FHD display
- regular: 16GB RAM, 2x 27" FHD display
- power user: 32GB RAM, 1x 42"+ 4K UHD display

The intent is to make everything distribution-agnostic, however that lofty goal is far away.

Currently everything has been tested with `Ubuntu 19.10 eoan ermine` and parts rely on `apt` and `snap`.
